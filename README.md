 - Contributions are greatly welcomed!!
 - This theme is heavily inspired by the VS Code dark theme

<h2>Things that need to be done</h2>

 - Either inject darktheme.js into the offical Vex Code v5 app or make a new one that just loads codev5.vex.com with darktheme.js (and gets serial support to work)
